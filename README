Giles
-------
TEST
@ Tony Ho

A Google Talk Robot with Eyes on Github

Install 
-------

Giles uses bundler to get her deps. 
Use 'bundle install' to set things up.

You'll need to provide Gtalk credentials for Giles:

Fill in: 
botUsername = ''
botPassword = ''

Giles also needs your Github API key before you can use her.
Check out http://peter-murach.github.com/github and
http://developer.github.com

Fill in:

opts with the credentials that you need

in bot/mcore.rb

You can customise Giles's behavior in giles.rb

Run
---

Just execute run.sh

If you peek inside run.sh, you'll see that all it does is bundle exec, making
Giles something perfectly suitable for use on Heroku.
